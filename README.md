# üòÑ Emotion Classification using CNN  
A deep learning model built with **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify human emotions (Happy vs Sad) from images.  

---  

---

## üß† Overview  
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect emotions from facial expressions.  
The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, and normalized for efficient training, and the model achieves solid accuracy with early stopping and dropout regularization.

## ‚ú® Features  
- üßπ **Automated data cleaning** to remove invalid or corrupted images  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Custom CNN architecture** for binary emotion detection  
- üîÑ **Early stopping** to prevent overfitting  
- üß† **Trained on 256√ó256 RGB images** with normalization  
- üíæ Model saved as `emotion_cnn_model.h5` for reuse or deployment
